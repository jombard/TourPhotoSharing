<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>TourPic operates tourpic.co.uk and may operate other websites. It is TourPic’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

<h4>Website Visitors</h4>
<p>Like most website operators, TourPic collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TourPic’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TourPic’s visitors use its website. From time to time, TourPic may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

<p>TourPic also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on tourpic.co.uk blogs/sites. TourPic only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.</p>

<h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>Certain visitors to TourPic’s websites choose to interact with TourPic in ways that require TourPic to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TourPic gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at tourpic.co.uk to provide an email address. Those who engage in transactions with TourPic are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, TourPic collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with TourPic. TourPic does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

<h4>Aggregated Statistics</h4>
<p>TourPic may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. TourPic may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, TourPic does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>TourPic discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TourPic’s behalf or to provide services available at TourPic’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TourPic’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TourPic will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TourPic discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when TourPic believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TourPic, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an TourPic website and have supplied your email address, TourPic may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with TourPic and our products. If you send us a request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. TourPic takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. TourPic uses cookies to help TourPic identify and track visitors, their usage of TourPic website, and their website access preferences. TourPic visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using TourPic’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of TourPic’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, TourPic may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in TourPic’s sole discretion. TourPic encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a tourpic.co.uk account, you might also receive an alert informing you of these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
